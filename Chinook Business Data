# For this project, I downloaded Chinook data that included tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers..
# Then, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

# 1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country FROM chinook.customers
    WHERE Country <> "USA"

# 2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Brazil" ;

# 3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
FROM chinook.invoices as inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust 
on inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

# 4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent" ;

# 5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.Invoices ;

# 6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

# 7.  Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT employ.FirstName AS Employ_FirstName, employ.LastName AS Employ_LastName, cust.FirstName AS Cust_FirstName, cust.LastName AS Cust_LastName, cust.Country, inv.Total  FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
    LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
    ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
    LEFT JOIN chinook.employees AS employ
    ON cust.SupportRepId = employ.EmployeeId
    WHERE employ.Title = "Sales Support Agent";
    
# 8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Invoices_in_2009
    FROM chinook.Invoices
    WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

# 9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total) AS Total_Sales_in_2009
    FROM chinook.Invoices
    WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

# 10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

# 11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

# 12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
